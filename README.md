# picList
An app witch store in a list pics taken by IPhone 
Its an Ynov Bordeaux AppleLab Project. 
The aim is to develop my SwiftUI skills, use a native component (Camera), and make a bridge between UIKit and SwiftUI.
The biggest difficulty that I find was to isolate the @FetchRequest in my viewModel. 
I saw on Stackoverflow that It's not possible : https://stackoverflow.com/questions/60101859/how-to-use-fetchrequest-outside-a-view
